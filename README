README 

This is the demonstration project for my application to join Apollo Live.

This is deployed on Google App Engine at: hybrid-skill-733.blogspot.com. 
The username to edit/delete/create posts is: apollo
and the password is: demonstration.

The ApolloBlog folder can be ignored. I started out working with pure Django, but hit stumbling blocks with authenticationn and deployment when I tried to move it to GAE and Google Cloud SQL. I then switched to using django-nonrel, and had much more success with that. I've left the ApolloBlog folder here so as not to hide anything that might weigh in to your decision making process.

Things I would improve if I had more time:
- When you log out, it drops you at the default Django admin logout screen, rather than taking you back to the main page
- In the templates, there's a mix of native strings and {% trans %} strings
- Add automated tests to the project
